# Challenge_20_Ethereum_Smart_Contract_Creation_&_Deployment
The objective of this challenge is to create a Solidity smart contract that accepts 2 addresses; These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account on the Ethereum Blockchain. The contract will have the functionality to deposit, withdraw, check the outstanding balance and the security protocols to prevent access to the account without permission.
